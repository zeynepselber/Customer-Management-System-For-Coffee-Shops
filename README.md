We want to write a customer management system for coffee shops.
We work for Starbucks and Nero companies.
Both companies want to register their customers in the database.
When Starbucks customers are paying, they definitely want mernis verification.
Nero does not want such a thing when registering its customers.
Starbucks wants to earn stars for every coffee purchase for customers.
